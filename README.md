# BudgetMaster

**Background:**
Company X, a subsidiary of Sri Lanka's prominent apparel manufacturer Group A, specializes in offering 
Finance and Human Resource services to other Group A subsidiaries.

**Problem Statement:**
Company X currently relies on a mainstream ERP system for financial record-keeping, lacking comprehensive 
budget tracking capabilities. This limitation impairs financial monitoring and decision-making within the 
Finance team.

**Challenges with Existing Process:**
The existing budget tracking process involves exporting data from the ERP system monthly and manually 
updating each row of data in a spreadsheet software against the budgeted numbers. Despite the use of 
advanced spreadsheet formulae and having a standard template to record the data, this existing process of 
manually mapping and generating projections has several negative consequences:
• Negatively impacts KPI achievement by consuming time and resources.
• Results in cascading delays in financial tasks.
• Causes communication delays, affecting stakeholders' timely decision-making.

**Objectives:**
This project aims to,
• Develop a user-friendly, cost-effective web-based budget tracking tool tailored to Company X's 
needs.
• Expedite the mapping and forecasting process to a one-day turnaround.
• Implement robust budget vs. actual variance analysis by WD4.
• Enable year-end profit/loss projection based on actual data by WD5.
• Enhance resource allocation decision-making.
• Visualize revenue and cost trends with a minimum of three data visualizations.

**Scope and Approach:**
The solution will consist of three key modules:
• Upload Data: Users can easily upload actual income and expenses monthly in an ERP-friendly 
format, replacing the manual and time-consuming process of matching budget numbers against 
actuals.
• View Forecast: The tool provides a forward-looking perspective, generating projections based on 
logical algorithms using uploaded actuals, thus eliminating delays.
• View Insights: Customizable charts provide a snapshot of financial data, facilitating quick 
comprehension of trends, patterns, and areas requiring attention.

The scope of the project includes the development of the web-based budget tracking tool, as well as the 
training of the Finance team on how to use the tool. The approach to the project will be as follows:
• Project management: The project will be managed using a waterfall methodology.
• Analysis and design: The tool will be designed using user-centered design principles.
• Implementation: The tool will be implemented using a cloud-based platform.
• Testing: The tool will be tested using both manual and automated methods.

**Fitness for Purpose:**
Success will be demonstrated by:
• User-friendliness, requiring minimal training.
• Detailed financial tracking, surpassing ERP limitations.
• Cost-effectiveness within budget constraints.
